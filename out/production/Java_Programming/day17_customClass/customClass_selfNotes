CUSTOM CLASS AND OBJECT


-Writing a custom class , you have to use instance Variables and instance Methods

public class Dog {

        public String name;
        public String breed;
        public String size;
        public int age;
        public String color;

}

Instance Methods:   - Does not have static keyword
                    - Belongs to the object
                    - Each object has a separate copy of the instance methods

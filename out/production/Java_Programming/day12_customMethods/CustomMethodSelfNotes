Components of Method

public static void displayMessage () {   that how we create a method in a method body

}

Access modifier:   public
        determines the visibility, public is open to the world and always accessible
Static modifier:  static
        allows us to call the method through the class name
Return Type:     void
        determine if the method returns a value. The same rules that apply to variable names also apply to method names
Method Name:     displayMessage
        method name is always followed by a set of parenthesis, can be capable of receiving arguments


   --> if we want this greetings method to be executed, it has to be in main method

   CUSTOM METHODS
    1. Void Methods
    2. Parameters
    3. Return Methods
    4. Return with parameters
    5. Method Overloading
!!! Methos has to be created in the class

!!!  methods can be in the same body, within the class out side of the method
it does not matter if you create the main method or your method first.
as long as your method will be printed in main body it will be executed

Passing Argument to Method
- when we declare a method, parameters an be given
- Parameters passed to the method act like variables
- Used for providing additional information the method must have to perform its task

Ex:     public static void displayValue (int num){
        System.out.println("The value is " + num);
        }

Calling Method That Need Information
- Must specify the values the method should use
- values need to be given in the parenthesis that follows method name
- the values we passed to the method are called arguments
- Arguments can be provided as values or as variables

Ex: displayValue (5);

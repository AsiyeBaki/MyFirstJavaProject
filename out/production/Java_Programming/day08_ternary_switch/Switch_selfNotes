                SWITCH STATEMENTS - Brief Class Notes -


        there are 4 type of conditions that SWITCH does NOT accept
        boolean, long, float, double
        boolean condition ONLY for 'IF statements' and 'TERNARY' in java
        long can not be acceptable in switch, it must be evaluated to a single value only, numbers or characters
        float can not be acceptable in switch
        double is not accepted in the switch,
        int byte short char are accepted in the switch.



        Switch statements: switch, case, default, break, can include to switch statements what can be member of switch statements



        syntax:
                switch(data/variable) {

                case data1:
                        Statements;
                        break;
                case data2:
                        Statements;
                        break;
                case data3:
                        Statements;
                        break;
                default:
                        Statements;

                }

                Switch expression (Data) can not be boolean, float, double, long

                Case block' value must be UNIQUE

                break: used for exiting the switch
                default block gets executed if none of the case values match with switch expression
                or logic we can use it in swwitch by declaring the case blocks back to back







                        // Import Statements
        Scanner class is presented in java.util package, and need to be imported in our program to use it.
        Import statements needs to be placed right after the package statement

        * import java.util.Scanner;
        import is 'keyword'
        java.util is 'package'
        Scanner is 'class'


        Import Statements:  used for importing one java file to another

                regular import: imports one single class from the specified package

                        import package.className


                wild import: imports everything from the package
                        import package.*;

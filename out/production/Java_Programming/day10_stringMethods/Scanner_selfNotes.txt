    Scanner Self Notes


        input.close(); // scanner is closed, can not read user inputs again

        // it will give an error to print fifth number and the statements after it,
        // since scanner is closed at line 33

        // input.reset() <-- this is one of the ways to reopen it, BUT it will not let you do it after certain times


// when we are importing from Scanner or any package, we have to provide
the import statement. For Scanner: import java.util.Scanner;
// when you call the system.out.println, system automatically
prints the import statement " import java.lang.system" . its statement actually is always there


        // for "System" we do not need to

        System.out.println("Enter your fifth number: ");
        double num5 = input.nextDouble(); // or float, float num3 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter your sixth number: ");
        float num6 = (float) input.nextDouble();



        SCANNER METHODS

        nextByte()
        nextShort()
        nextInt()
        nextLong()
        nextFloat()
        nextDouble()
        nextBoolean()

        //        IMPORT STATEMENT
        //import java.util.Scanner; <-- regular import
        // import java.util.*;       <-- wild import
        // using wild import is like; buying entire grocery store instead of one item like cherry the only item you need
        // it costs more memory and it is not rational, Scanner helps us to pull specific files
        // import statement: used for importing one java file to another
        // regular import: imports one single class from a package
        // import package.className
        // wild import: imports whole package
        // import package.*;




        // input.nextLine() will print the entire line, as "Today is Friday"
        // vs. to input.next() will print word by word

        // if there is nothing in Test.txt file it will give an error of NoSuchElementException
